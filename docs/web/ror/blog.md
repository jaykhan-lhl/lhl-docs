# Blog

Ruby on Rails makes it very easy to setup a simple blogging app with a database, authentication, views and models.

## Setup
  
### 1. Check Ruby version in the console

```bash
ruby --version
```

Mine returns `ruby 3.0.0p0`

If you don't have ruby installed, go [here]().

### 2. install Rails

```bash
gem install rails
```

### 3. Create a new Rails app

```bash
rails new mpapp
```

## Scaffold
