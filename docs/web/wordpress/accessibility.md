## Best practices

>The AODA requires that public-facing websites meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level A and AA criteria. WCAG was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is the internationally accepted standard for web accessibility. 

### Plugins

- [WordPress Accessibility Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/)

>This plug-in helps with a variety of common accessibility problems in WordPress themes. While most accessibility issues canâ€™t be addressed without directly changing your theme, WP Accessibility adds a number of helpful accessibility features with a minimum amount of setup or expert knowledge.
